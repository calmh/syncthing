## Reporting Bugs

Please file bugs in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues). Include at
least the following:

 - What happened

 - What did you expect to happen instead of what *did* happen, if it's
   not crazy obvious

 - What operating system, operating system version and version of
   Syncthing you are running

 - The same for other connected devices, where relevant

 - Screenshot if the issue concerns something visible in the GUI

 - Console log entries, where possible and relevant

If you're not sure whether something is relevant, erring on the side of
too much information will never get you yelled at. :)

## Contributing Translations

All translations are done via
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/syncthing/). If you wish
to contribute to a translation, just head over there and sign up.
Before every release, the language resources are updated from the
latest info on Weblate.

Note that the previously used service at
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/syncthing/) is being
retired and we kindly ask you to sign up on Weblate for continued
involvement.

## Contributing Code

Every contribution is welcome. If you want to contribute but are unsure
where to start, any open issues are fair game! See the [Contribution
Guidelines](https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/contributing.html) for the full
story on committing code.

## Contributing Documentation

Updates to the [documentation site](https://docs.syncthing.net/) can be
made as pull requests on the [documentation
repository](https://github.com/syncthing/docs).

## The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The Syncthing project requires the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
sign-off on pull requests (PRs). This means that all commit messages must
contain a signature line to indicate that the developer accepts the DCO.

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote (or
otherwise have the right to submit) the code and changes they are
contributing to the project. Here is the full [text of the
DCO](https://developercertificate.org):

---

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the
   right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file;
   or

2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
   knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have
   the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,
   whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source
   license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
   indicated in the file; or

3. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
   certified (1), (2) or (3) and I have not modified it.

4. I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public
   and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information
   I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and
   may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source
   license(s) involved.

---

Contributors indicate that they adhere to these requirements by adding
a `Signed-off-by` line to their commit messages.  For example:

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

The name and email address in this line must match those of the committing
author.

## Licensing

All contributions are made available under the same license as the already
existing material being contributed to. For most of the project and unless
otherwise stated this means MPLv2, but there are exceptions:

- Certain commands (under cmd/...) may have a separate license, indicated by
  the presence of a LICENSE file in the corresponding directory.

- The documentation (man/...) is licensed under the Creative Commons
  Attribution 4.0 International License.

- Projects under vendor/... are copyright by and licensed from their
  respective original authors. Contributions should be made to the original
  project, not here.

Regardless of the license in effect, you retain the copyright to your
contribution.
